Version PHP 5.1.6 and above:

1. Enter the MySQL shell and run the following command:

set global slow_query_log = 'ON';

2. Enable any other desired options. Here are some common examples:

Log details for queries expected to retrieve all rows instead of using an index:

   set global log_queries_not_using_indexes = 'ON'
Set the path to the slow query log:

  set global slow_query_log_file ='/var/log/mysql/slow-query.log';
Set the amount of time a query needs to run before being logged:

   set global long_query_time = 20;
     (default is 10 seconds)
3. Confirm the changes are active by entering the MySQL shell and running the following command:

show variables like '%slow%';
